### Frontplate generation notes

sorry, non free software. Hopefully it keeps working for a while. I'll include SVGs of the frontplate so it can continue to be edited.

export the mask and silkscreen groups to pngs that are 5119x7875 (aka 2000dpi)

import into kicad using the image converter tool. Use the output size settings  to 65mm / 100.1mm (set lock height width ratio).

for both images, you will need to use the "negative" button to invert correctly.

in the pcb editor, double click on the footprints, then update from library. You may need to disable layers so you can correctly double click on the soldermask footprint.
